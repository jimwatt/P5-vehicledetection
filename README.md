# Vehicle Detection and Tracking

This project is in conjunction with the Udacity Self-Driving Car course.  In particular, the goal of this project is to train a SVM to detect vehicles from video imagery.  Given an input video of the road ahead, this code will track the vehicles in the video and annotate them with bounding boxes.

* More detail about the lane finding approach is provided in writeup.md.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Imported packages include:

```
Python
cv2
matplotlib
moviepy
glob
```

### Installing

No install is required --- simply clone this project from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/jimwatt/P5-vehicledetection.git
```

## Running the Code

* The starting point for the code is `p5code.py`.  In the top directory, run 

  `ipython p5code.py`

  Consider changing flags in main() to switch between processing video and still images.
